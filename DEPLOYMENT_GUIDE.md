## Option 1: Using Replit's Built-in Git (Easiest)

1. **In your current Replit project:**
   - Click the **"Version Control"** tab in the left sidebar (looks like a branch icon)

2. **In the Shell, run these commands:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: E-commerce AI Agent with real data"

3. **Create a new GitHub repository:**
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com) → Click "+" → "New repository"
   - Name it: `ecommerce-ai-agent`
   - Don't initialize with README
   - Copy the repository URL

4. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ecommerce-ai-agent.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```
